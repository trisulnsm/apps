5. DNS AAAA IPv6
6. SSL SNI
7. SSL Certificate CN (Common name)
8. SSL Certifcate  SAN (Subject Alternative Names)
9. SSL SHA1 Hashes 
10. HTTP URLs
11. HTTP Host

This apps creates a new Resource Stream called *Intel Harvest* with GUID *"{EE1C9F46-0542-4A7E-4C6A-55E2C4689419}"*. You can just listen to the resorces on this stream and write code to do something with them. See `intel_print.lua` which just prints them to the terminal. 

## What is the use of this Harvestor ?

> This is a building block APP. This gives you all Intel items in a single stream, you can plug this into any Intel checking code. 

## Installing 

To install this APP logon as admin, then select APP from _Web Admin > Manage > Apps._

## Saving to backend database

By default , this APP stores the harvested candidate IOC to the backend Hub database. This can take up significant disk space on busy networks. To prevent saving this stream, create a config file at `/usr/local/var/lib/trisul-probe0/domain0/probe0/contextX/config/trisulnsm_ioc-harvestor.lua` and put the following

````lua
return {
	SaveHarvestedItems=false,
} 
````
